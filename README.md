# Approach

## Entrypoint
- flake.nix

This is meant to be global source of truth for machines that I work with. This includes:
1. My personal machine
2. Machines i use for self hosting

# The approach I'm taking to learn nix
- I started with how I wanted my nix.flake file to read. It should easily tell the narrative that aligns with
- my approach. Using psuedocode, I outlined how I wanted it to read and from there I started looking at the nix
- reference manual for the API that would support the narrative. I think this helps in me not being overwhelmed,
- Humans want a close approximation to what they are trying to work on.
